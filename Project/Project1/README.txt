My Week is an application that allows the user to organize his week by creating a weekly planner.
The program simply asks the user to make a choice from the menu and follow the the steps.
My Week
The program was supposed to have a remove-task function, but the file I/O, which is more important, consumed a large chunck of the programmer's time.
The file I/O does not work!
The program spits out a binary file that cannot be read by either the human who is setting behind the screen or the application that has created it.
My Week adds tasks with no problems as long as instructions are followed.
The Multidementional dynamic array gets deleted as intended. Meaning the sub-arrays get deleted and then the main array. Hence, no memory leaks were identified.
In a nut shell, My Week is a stigma in my history of two semesters as a programmer.
